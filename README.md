# bash-mysql-migrations

Simple script creating migrations for MySQL databases.
If you have a pleasure to use legacy frameworks that didn't have their own migration scripts - feel free to use.

## How to use?

1. Clone
2. Put your queries to `queries` directory
3. Copy `config.sh.dist`  to `config.sh`
4. Set your database credentials in `config.sh`
5. Run script (./migrate.sh)

Enjoy!
